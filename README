Gyrid is a Bluetooth device scanning daemon. When there is a Bluetooth adapter
connected to the computer, it continuously scans for Bluetooth-enabled devices
which are publicly visible. Their MAC-addresses are saved to a logfile including
a timestamp and their device class (which is a number that indicates whether
the device is a phone, a carkit, etc.).

The idea behind this is scientifical. When multiple of these scanners are placed
at known positions, the logfiles can be combined afterwards into a (geo)database
and used for further analysis.
