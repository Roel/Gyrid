Gyrid is a Bluetooth device scanner. When there is a Bluetooth adapter connected
to the computer, it continuously scans for Bluetooth-enabled devices which are
publicly visible. Their MAC-addresses are saved to a logfile including a timestamp
and their device class (which is a number that indicates whether the device is a
phone, a carkit, etc.).

The idea behind this is scientifical. When multiple of these scanners are placed
at known positions, the logfiles can be combined into a (geo)database and used
for further analysis. This can be done in realtime via a network server or in
postprocessing.
