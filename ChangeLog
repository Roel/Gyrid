gyrid 0.1

   * Added configuration option to specify the timeformat being used.
   * Switch from full IEEE data to a trimmed down version keeping all
   information. Added script to generate this file.
   * Introduced the concept of ScanManagers to simplify the definition
   of program behaviour. We have two ScanManagers at present:
      - SerialScanManager: This default ScanManager scans with one
      Bluetooth adaptor at the time.
      - ParallelScanManager: Not fully matured ScanManager that ought to
      scan with multiple adaptors simultaneously.
   * Print error message when starting while already running.
   * Don't reduce logged tracebacks to a single line.
   * Fix serious bug on logrotation causing data corruption.

-- Roel Huybrechts <roel.huybrechts@ugent.be>  Thu, 19 Nov 2009 11:38:16 +0100

   * The separate lists from previous version were not such a smart idea
   after all. Same problem in a new package.
   * We now use locking facilities instead to ensure only one thread can 
   access the pool at the same time.
   * Minor changes in the debug output, logrotation and the transmission of
   variables.

-- Roel Huybrechts <roel.huybrechts@ugent.be>  Wed, 24 Jun 2009 20:07:32 +0200

bluetracker 0.0.10

   * Use a separate list for new devices. They're no longer immediately
   added to the pool, but are added by the poolchecker thread.
